##Base

* css rest

* variable
* fonts



##Layout

The minor components—such as
a callout, or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope
of major components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor
components as Modules and will dive into those in the next section.
The major components are referred to as Layout styles.

* [login]
* [header or footer]
* [css rest]
* [css rest]



```css
	 #header, #article, #footer {
		width: 960px;
		margin: auto;
		}
		#article {
		border: solid #CCC;
		border-width: 1px 0 0;
		}
```

##Module

A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles.
For example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or expanded
state. A message may be in a success or error state.
